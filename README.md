# üìÇPortfolio :

[Project 1: Mimic III Full Stack application](https://github.com/StamKavid/Mimic_III_full_stack_application)

The goal of this application is to analyze the correlation between patients' interactions and the duration of their hospital stay. By utilizing data from the MIMIC III database and implementing a full stack solution, this project aims to provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals to optimize patient care and reduce length of stay.

[Project 2: COVID-19 Forecasting](https://github.com/StamKavid/COVID_19_simple_analysis)

This project utilizes time series analysis to forecast the number of COVID-19 cases for the next 30 days. By implementing the Facebook Prophet model and utilizing real-world data, this project aims to provide insight into the potential spread of the virus and assist in pandemic response planning.

[Project 3: MNIST Image Classification](https://github.com/StamKavid/MNIST_image_classification)

This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, specifically on the MNIST dataset. By implementing a CNN architecture inspired by LeNet-5, this project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs for image recognition tasks and serve as a foundation for further research in the field.
